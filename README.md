Project:

Today's date is 5/31/2021. Working on the Google Homepage Project through The Odin Project. I have learned the very basics of HTML and CSS through FreeCodeCamps responsive web design course. Only went through the excersises and did not do the projects as TOP deemed it as optional. Will be using HTML, CSS, and inspect element (as well as searching up stuff on Google) to create a replica of the Google Homepage. There will not be js or more complex features that the Google HomePage has. Also I am making this on Memorial Day so the Google HomePage will be slightly different than how it normally looks. 

6/1/2021: Decided to make it the regular Google HomePage design. Finished project following morning.

6/3/2021: Added a javascript function that works with the input field to search up the user inquiry on google. Only is called when a user presses the enter key.
